Hi, I am Do June. 

This is the first post for my blog, which will feature articles presenting and explaining some for the works that I did, either for school or independently.

Also, I'm planning to post my thoughts on the fields that I am interested in, which you can check out [here](https://mindojune.github.io/about.html).

Don't forget to check out [portfolio](https://mindojune.github.io/portfolio.html).

Feel free to contact me through email.
